* When you click on the button to "List People" it should list out the people from the arrOfPeople.
* Each listed person should have a button called "Make Player" next to their name
* When clicked on the "Make Player" button the selected person should get added into the "Dodge Ball Players" List
* Each player will now have two buttons, Blue Team and Red Team, so that they can get selected into a team when the button is clicked
* Once one of the button is clicked, the player will get moved out of its original list and added into their teams section showing just their name
